what is the document??

        A document is a form of information that might be useful to a user or set of users. This information can be in digital and nondigital forms. Accordingly, a document can be either digital or nondigital. Different methods are used to store digital and nondigital documents.

A nondigital or paper document can be physically stored in a file cabinet, whereas an electronic or digital document is stored in a computer as one or more files. Digital documents can also be part of a database. Electronic document management programs deal with the management, storage and security of electronic documents.

what is the window objects??

        The window object represents a window in browser. An object of window is created automatically by the browser.

Window is the object of browser, it is not the object of javascript. The javascript objects are string, array, date etc.
